DTGP (Dependently Typed Genetic Programming)
============================================

## Description ##

Supplementary code and material for the paper [Verified Stack-Based
Genetic Programming via Dependent Types](http://github.com/larrytheliquid/dtgp/raw/aaip11/doc/dtgp.pdf), under consideration for
publication in [4th International Workshop on Approaches and
Applications of Inductive
Programming](http://www.cogsys.wiai.uni-bamberg.de/aaip11/).

## Dependencies ##

Agda version 2.2.10
Agda standard library version 0.5

## Mono ##

For code with examples that are most similar to the paper, see the
[src/mono](http://github.com/larrytheliquid/dtgp/tree/aaip11/src/mono)
directory. Here the examples only support the evolution of programs
with a single type.

## Poly ##

For code with examples that support the evolution of programs with
multiple types, see the
[src/poly](http://github.com/larrytheliquid/dtgp/tree/aaip11/src/poly) directory.
